# Add simple two tests:
- Click button, wait a bit, see customer data, test for it. 
- adapt above for: 
    - react state-only test: click button, see that toggleColor works. (Test dom changes)

Try all three paradigms.
- enzyme
- puppeteer
- @testing-library/react

# Intermediate test:
- Maybe add loading icon for additional complexity. Break tests then fix.
